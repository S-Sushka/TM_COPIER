## >>> HOW TO GET STARTED WITH SERIAL COPIER
#### 1) Assemble the device according with TM_COPIER_USING_SERIAL/Scheme.jpg
#### 2) Open TM_COPIER_USING_SERIAL/TM_COPIER_USING_SERIAL.ino
#### 3) Add "OneWire" library
Sketch > Include Library > Manage libraries. Search `OneWire` by `Paul Stoffregen`
#### 4) Upload sketch to Arduino

## >>> HOW TO GET STARTED WITH PCB COPIER
#### 1) Assemble the PCB using TM_COPIER.lay6 (OPEN WITH Sprint-layout 6)
